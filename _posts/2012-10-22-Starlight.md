I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"

It was the best night, never would forget how we moved

The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight

Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45

Picked me up, late one night at the window

We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild

Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in

The night we snuck into a yacht club party

Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"

It was the best night, never would forget how we moved

The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you

Worrying so much about things you can't change

You'll spend your whole life singing the blues

If you keep thinking that way"

He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me

"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?

Don't you dream impossible things?"

Joeboy 'Sip (Alcohol)' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified

Like, "Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"

It was the best night, never would forget how we moved

The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy

Ooh, ooh, dancing with me

Ooh, ooh, we could get married

Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh, my, what a marvelous tune

It was the best night, never would forget how we moved

The whole place was dressed to the nines

And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams

Like starlight, starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams

Don't you see the starlight, starlight?

Don't you dream impossible things?

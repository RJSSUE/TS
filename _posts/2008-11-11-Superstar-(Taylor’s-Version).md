This is wrong but I can't help but feel like

There ain’t nothing more right babe

Misty morning comes again and I can't

Help but wish I could see your face

And I knew from the first note played

I'd be breaking all my rules to see you

You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row

Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like

I can't keep my eyes off of you

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning lonelinеss

Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you

Whеn my world wakes up today

You'll be in another town

And I knew when I saw your face

I'd be counting down the ways to see you

You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row

Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like

I can't take my eyes off of you

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar

And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are

And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep

Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like

I can't take my eyes off of you

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you

Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Sweet, sweet superstar

Superstar

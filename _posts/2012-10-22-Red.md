Loving him is like

Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin

Ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind

Once you're already flying through the free fall

Like the colors in autumn, so bright

Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark gray, all alone

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

But loving him was red

(Red, red)

(Red, red)

Loving him was red

(Red, red)

(Red, red)

Touching him was like

Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you

Memorizing him was as

Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like

Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer

Regretting him was like

Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

But loving him was red

(Red, red)

Oh, red (Red, red)

Burning red (Red, red)

(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go

But moving on from him is impossible

When I still see it all in my head

In burning red

Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known

Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)

Forgetting him was like

Trying to know somebody you never met

'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)

Burning red (Red, red)

(Red, red)

And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head

Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red

(Red, red) Yeah, yeah

(Red, red)

His love was like

Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

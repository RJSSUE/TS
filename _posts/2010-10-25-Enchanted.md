There I was again tonight

Forcing laughter, faking smiles

Same old tired, lonely place

Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"

'Cross the room your silhouette

Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts

Counter all your quick remarks

Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you

All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling

Don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck

Blushing all the way home

I'll spend forever

Wondering if you knew

I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up

2AM, who do you love?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake

And now I'm pacing back and forth

Wishing you were at my door

I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"

It was enchanting to meet you

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling

Don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck

Blushing all the way home

I'll spend forever

Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless

Don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck

Dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever

Wondering if you knew

I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that

This was the very first page

Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name

Until I see you again

These are the words I held back

As I was leaving too soon

I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love

With someone else

Please don't have somebody

Waiting on you

Please don't be in love (Ooh)

With someone else

Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey)

Waiting on you

This night is sparkling

Don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck

Blushing all the way home

I'll spend forever

Wondering if you knew

This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)

Don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)

Dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)

Wondering if you knew

I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love

With someone else

Please don't have somebody

Waiting on you

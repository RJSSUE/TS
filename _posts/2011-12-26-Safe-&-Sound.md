I remember tears streaming down your face

When I said I'll never let you go

When all those shadows almost killed your light

I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"

But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes

The sun is going down

You'll be alright

No one can hurt you now

Come morning light

You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window

Darling, everything's on fire

The war outside our door keeps raging on

Hold on to this lullaby

Even when (the) music's gone

Gone

Just close your eyes

The sun is going down

You'll be alright

No one can hurt you now

Come morning light

You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

Just close your eyes

You'll be alright

Come morning light

You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh oh oh

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel

Comes out just when you need it to

As I paced back and forth all this time

'Cause I honestly believed in you

Holdin' on, the days drag on

Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

Now it's too late for you and your white horse

To come around

Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes

And never really had a chance

My mistake, I didn't know to bе in love

You had to fight to have the uppеr hand

I had so many dreams about you and me

Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

Now it's too late for you and your white horse

To come around

And there you are on your knees

Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me

Just like I always wanted

But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale

I'm gonna find someone someday

Who might actually treat me well

This is a big world, that was a small town

There in my rearview mirror disappearing now

And it's too late for you and your white horse

Now it's too late for you and your white horse

To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Try and catch me now, oh

It's too late to catch me now

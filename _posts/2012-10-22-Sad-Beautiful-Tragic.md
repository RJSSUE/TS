Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket

Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late

I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket

Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love affair

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation

We both wake in lonely beds, different cities

And time is taking its sweet time erasing you

And you've got your demons

And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting

Silence, the train runs off its tracks

Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?

Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there

What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there

What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there

What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

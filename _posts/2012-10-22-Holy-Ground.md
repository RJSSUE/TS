I was reminiscing just the other day

While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away

Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time

Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go

Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know

I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made

And that was the first day

And darling, it was good

Never looking down

And right there where we stood

Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

We had this big wide city all to ourselves

We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"

And for the first time, I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way

And the story's got dust on every page

But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now

And I see your face in every crowd

Joeboy 'Sip (Alcohol)' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified

'Cause darling, it was good

Never looking down

And right there where we stood

Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance

For all that we've been through

But I don't wanna dance

If I'm not dancing with you

Tonight, I'm gonna dance

Like you were in this room

But I don't wanna dance

If I'm not dancing with you

It was good

Never looking down

And right there where we stood

Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance

For all that we've been through

But I don't wanna dance

If I'm not dancing with you

Tonight, I'm gonna dance

Like you were in this room

But I don't wanna dance

If I'm not dancing with you

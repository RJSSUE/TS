I could go back to every laugh

But I don't wanna go there anymore

And I know all the steps up to your door

But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky

Talk to the man with the reasons why

And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open

'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name

Just know I'm right here hoping

That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song

But I don't wanna have to go that far

And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart

And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears

Talk to the man who put you here

And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open

'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh

Just know I'm right here hoping

That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name

I don't know what else I can say

I'll leave my window open

'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games

Just know I'm right here hoping

That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh

But I don't wanna go there anymore

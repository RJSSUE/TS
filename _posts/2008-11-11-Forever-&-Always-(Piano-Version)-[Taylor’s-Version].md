Once upon a time

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye

And we caught onto something

I hold on to the night

You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?

'Cause it seems to me

This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak

I don't feel welcome anymore

What happened? Please, tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect

Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"

And it rains in your bedroom

Everything is wrong

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

Was I out of line?

Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide

Like a scared little boy?

I looked into your eyes

Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?

Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom

Everything is wrong

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Back up, baby, back up

Did you forget everythi-i-ing?

Back up, baby, back up

Did you forget everythi-i-ing?

Back up, baby, back up

Please, back up, oh, back up

Back up, baby, back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom

Everything is wrong

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

You flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom

Everything is wrong

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby

You said, "Forever and always," yeah

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around

I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out

And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore

I won't pick up the phone

This is the last straw

Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can tell me that you're sorry

But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

You're not sorry

No, no, oh-oh

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waiting in the cold

And you've got your sharе of secrets

And I'm tired of being last to know, oh

And now you're asking me to listen

'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore

I won't pick up the phone

This is the last straw

Don't wanna hurt anymore

And you can tell me that you're sorry

But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

You're not sorry

No, no, oh-oh

You're not sorry

No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey

And it never would've gone away, no

You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore

I won't pick up the phone

This is the last straw

There's nothing left to beg for

And you can tell me that you're sorry

But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

You're not sorry

No, no, oh-oh

You're not sorry

No, no, oh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

I know that you like me

And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'

And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

But now you're so far away and I'm down

Feelin' like a face in the crowd

I'm reachin' for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love

I could be the one that you dream of

A message in a bottle is all I can do

Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

You could be the one that I keep, and I

I could be the reason you can't sleep at night

A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do

Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you

These days I'm restless

Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me

But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster

'Cause now you're so far away and I'm down

Feelin' like a face in the crowd

I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause

'Cause you could be the one that I love

I could be the one that you dream of

A message in a bottle is all I can do

Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)

You could be the one that I keep, and I (I)

I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At night)

A message in a bottle is all I can do

Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

How is it in London? (London)

Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)

If I'll ever see you again?

You could be the one that I love, mm-mm

And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)

I could be the one that you dream of

A message in a bottle is all I can do

Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)

You could be the one that I keep, and I

I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night)

A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)

Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (Yeah, yeah)

You could be the one that I love

You could be the one that I love, I love

And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights

Busy streets and busy lives

And all we know is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds

Or fades in time

And I never (Never)

Saw you coming

And I’ll never (Never)

Be the same

You come around and the armor falls

Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don’t let go

We are alone, just you and me

Up in your room and our slates are clean

Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint

And I've loved in shades of wrong

We learn to live with the pain

Mosaic broken hearts

But this love is brave and wild

And I never (Never)

Saw you coming

And I’ll never (Never)

Be the same

This is a state of grace

This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game

Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate

You’re my Achilles heel

This is the golden age

Of something good and right and real

And I never (Never)

Saw you coming

And I’ll never

Be the same

And I never (Never)

Saw you coming

And I’ll never (So you were never a saint)

(And I've loved in shades of wrong)

Be the same (We learn to live with the pain)

(Mosaic broken hearts)

(But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace

This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game

Unless you play it good and right

I have always been a big fan of Taylor Swift since junior high as her songs always provide me a deep resonance in a narrative way. No matter what stage I'm in and what age I'm at, I can always get relief from different parts of her songs. So I want to build a comprehensive and easy-to-use Taylor Swift song library, integrating all kinds of resources.

I found Taylor Swift album tracks and lyrics on Kaggle (TS/post_generator/archive) and merged these CSV files into one total file (TS/post_generator/total.csv). Then I referenced a Jekyll template as the framework of this website. Jekyll is a static site generator that renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates and produces a complete, static website. I found the logo of Taylor's signature from the "pikpng" website.

For each song, I build a webpage that displays its lyrics and the music videos (if any) and live shows (if any). I spent a long time figuring out the architecture logic of the template and wrote a python program (TS/post_generator/post-generator.ipynb) to generate markdown and html files based on the total.csv file that match the rendering conditions of the template. I stored the data frame from the process to info.csv (TS/post_generator/info.csv), saving the metadata corresponding to each song. I also Added and modified the scss setting according to the visual effect.

For the video resources, I searched manually on youtube and collect the youtube id into the "info.csv" file. Each file name contains the album release date and song name information. In this process I encountered some unexpected bugs, for example, some song names contain punctuation marks such as exclamation marks (ME!) and question marks (...ready for it?), which can interfere with the URL generated by the site. Referencing w3.org, "The question mark ("?", ASCII 3F hex) is used to delimit theÂ **boundary between the URI of a queryable object**, and a set of words used to express a query on that object. When this form is used, the combined URI stands for the object which results from the query being applied to the original object." Thus the question mark in the song would cause incorrect parsing of website-generated URLs. For these cases, I changed the name of the song by manually deleting the punctuations. I output the correspondence between the song name and the URL in the console (TS/post_generator/rjssue.github.io-1639535586287.log) and built the table (TS/post_generator/name_url.csv).

From class and readings, we learned about the faceted metadata system, where each category is semantically distinct from the others. Each song is assigned to multiple categories based on different features such as genre, theme, and albums. 

The dataset used for this project is a "collection":

- Resources: songs, music videos
- Selection Policy: written by Taylor Swift (or in collaboration with others)
- Organization:
  - chronologically ordered library catalog (in the "Songlist" section)
  - classified by albums, genre, theme
- Interactions
  - Browsing (lyrics)
  - Watching and listening (music videos)
  - Searching (in the search section)

I resonated with the reading "*Genre is Disappearing, What Comes Next?*" by Petrusich when I tried to classify the songs into genres. Pieces of music can, oftentimes, fall into multiple genres, and this attribution is highly subjective. Taylor came to the public eye as a country music songwriter, but she has continued to collaborate with a wide variety of musicians and actively explored other genres throughout her creative career. In the process of such innovative fusion, many songs inevitably fall in the middle ground of various genres and even create some new ones. As the reading suggests, the genre is not a static, immovable idea; it is this kind of innovation that allows the classification itself to evolve with time. But for this project, the facet requires that each category be distinct from the others, which made the categorization for each song very difficult, not to mention there is no strict criterion for such classification and hence highly subjective. Instead, I referred to Wikipedia's categorization of Taylor's albums; each of her albums had a major style for that period, so the songs under it were all roughly grouped into the same category.

I also found trouble when trying to tag songs with song themes: such categorization is very subjective and requires a very detailed and thorough understanding of the content of the songs (I wish I could show you my Amazon Music playlist for these weeks â€” Tayor's songs from morning to night ðŸ˜‚) Also, many of Taylor's songs (especially "folklore" and "evermore") are written in the narrative perspective, constructing virtual worlds, narrating and analyzing events, which makes it difficult to categorize them into a particular theme. Other songs fall in between many themes and cannot be simply classified (e.g. the first half with sad accusations, the second half with fantasy, and "what-if"s). Therefore, I only show songs that I think are typically classifiable as references.

In the "songlist" section, I displayed all songs in reverse chronological order: the latest released songs are at the top, and the last released songs are at the end. It supports the page flip feature.

The albums section displays all songs in waterfall format with the left sidebar displaying the albums category. Upon selecting one album, a hashtag followed by the album name will be added to the URL, and the list will jump to the specified location in the waterfall. Referencing w3.org, "The hash ("#", ASCII 23 hex) character is reserved as a delimiter to separate the URI of an object from a fragment identifier."

I looked through a lot of tutorials trying to build the search feature and found that javascript has a standard build-in RegExp object that supports regular expression-based matching. Although it is not the same as the elastic search we talked about in class, it also supports fuzzy matches. For example, if we want to search a fuzzy match word similar to "like", the query we build in elastic search would be "lik~", in RegExp would be "lik[a-z]". And it has some features that elastic search doesn't support, like some assertions. From a high level, elastic search supports various combinations between words in a query, while regular expression focuses more on the word itself: the order and structure of the letters within a word, and its context, i.e. (not) preceded or (not) followed by some word.

In all, this project is an extension and expansion of the knowledge learned in class. It is an extension of the github personal homepage assignment. I got to build and display an information retrieval system with collection using metadata, Github pages, HTML, CSS, JSON, and XML.
